## Ben Larson's Genode Depot

Currently, this just contains x86_64 builds of almost all the official Genode packages. Unfortunately, I haven't been able to setup a viewer so you can see what files I have, so just look at depot.genode.org and use the same names.

libpng and zlib currently aren't included, due to inconsistent versioning in the official genode depot.

Later, I will add some of my own packages, including a file manager.
